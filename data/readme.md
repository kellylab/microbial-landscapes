# Bermuda Atlantic Timeseries (BATS)
qPCR (quantitative) data describing the abundance of 5 ecotypes of the globally abundant marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus over a 5 year period in the Sargasso Sea .

## Questions:
* How predictable are seasonal changes in ecotype abundance?
* How many states does the community exist in over the course of a year?
* What would the most efficient sampling scheme be?
* How do dynamics of the same ecotype differ in the Sargasso Sea vs. the Pacific Ocean?

# Hawaii Ocean Timeseries (HOT)
qPCR (quantitative) data describing the abundance of 5 ecotypes of the globally abundant marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus over a 5 year period in the North Pacific Ocean.

# Nahant Timeseries (bacteria and eukaryotes)
16S data and 18S (relative) normalized counts of microbial taxa (rows, called "OTUs") from ~3 months of daily sampling off the coast of Nahant, MA. Much better resolution than the other datasets we have. BactNorm.txt is bacteria, EukNorm.txt is eukaryotes. This is a more complex dataset than the HOT/BATS datasets, it includes abundance data for large numbers of OTUs. The coastal environment is also thought of as more transitional and less stable than the open ocean sites that HOT/BATS are sampled from.
